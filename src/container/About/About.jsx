    //         while still studying at college. Having my own projects, coded mostly in React JS, I have learned a lot while working on these projects. Now I am looking to get a job or an internship to get some experience, and am glad to be interviewing with you here.

I always try to stay positive and find a way out. I am sure that everything happens for a reason and that any mistake can be fixed.</h4>
    //           <h4 className='hone'> * I am a quick learner and constantly improve my skills not only in professional but also in multiple other fields. If hired for the position, I will continue to learn and transfer obtained knowledge and skills to other team members.</h4>
